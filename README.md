# Electric_Field_Demo
Quick demo of electric fields and coulomb's law.

<br/>

The demo was created using Explicit Euler for the motion and using simple impulses for the collisions with the surface. The electric field is drawn as a vector field not using the electric field lines conventions (curves that don't cross, density represents strength, etc.)
